    "## What is Two Pointer Technique?\n",
    "\n",
    "Two pointer technique is normally used for **searching**, and it uses **two pointers in one loop** over the given data structure.\n",
    "This is a common approach used to solve coding problems, mostly related to **strings**, **arrays**, and **linked lists**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why You Must Know It?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use two pointers, most of the time the data structure needs to be **ordered** in some way.\n",
    "This helps reduce the time complexity from **O(nÂ²)** or **O(nÂ³)** to **O(n)** using just one loop,\n",
    "allowing you to **search each item only once**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, depending on whether the input string/array is sorted or not,\n",
    "the two-pointer method can take **O(n log n)** time complexity or even better, **O(n)**.\n",

    "## Variants of Two Pointer Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”· Opposite Directional\n",
    "- One pointer starts from the **beginning**, and the other starts from the **end**.\n",
    "- The pointers move **toward each other**, typically used when the array is **sorted**.\n",
    "- This variant is useful for problems where you're trying to find a **pair that meets a condition** (e.g., two numbers summing to a target).\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¶ Equi-directional\n",
    "- Both pointers start from the **beginning** of the array.\n",
    "- One pointer moves **faster** (fast-runner), and the other **slower** (slow-runner).\n",
    "- Commonly used for:\n",
    "  - **Cycle detection** (e.g., Floydâ€™s Tortoise and Hare)\n",
    "  - **Sliding window** problems (e.g., max sum of subarray of size `k`, longest substring without repeating characters)\n",
